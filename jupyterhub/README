This image attempts to pull all things that you may want to configure one day
for a Jupyterhub installation from Vault. This will allow us to manage all
configuration in Vault instead of spread across several files in addition
to Vault.

There are two places that may be configured directly in this repository:

.env - This file sets environment variables for the Makefile. It only contains
    # Name of Docker network
	DOCKER_NETWORK_NAME=jupyterhub-network

	# Single-user Jupyter Notebook server container images to pull, separate by spaces
	# All of these images will be pulled to the host on make so that we can switch the
	# different notebook installations to use different notebooks by updating Vault
	# and restarting the container.
	DOCKER_NOTEBOOK_IMAGES="aguidetti/r-datascience-notebook"

	# Name of JupyterHub container data volume
	DATA_VOLUME_HOST=jupyterhub-data

	# Data volume container mount point
	DATA_VOLUME_CONTAINER=/data

	# API key for datadog monitoring
	DATADOG_API_KEY= [ A datadog api key ]

docker-compose.yml - In addition to all the normal things you can do here, please set
    the following environment variables:

    AUTH0_SUBDOMAIN: avillachlab
    VAULT_BASE: secret/avl/testjason/jupyter_
    VAULT_TOKEN: [ A limited scope vault token, soon to be ROLE_ID and SECRET_ID ]  


Vault Config - The following variables must be set in the Vault path VAULT_BASE.
    
    AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL
	AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
	AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET
	DATA_VOLUME_CONTAINER
	DOCKER_NETWORK_NAME
	DOCKER_NOTEBOOK_DIR
	DOCKER_NOTEBOOK_IMAGE
	DOCKER_SPAWN_CMD
	SSL_CERT - use @filename when setting value
	SSL_KEY - use @filename when setting value
	USERLIST - use @filename when setting value
